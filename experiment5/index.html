				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Loads images and generates paramaterized versions of them using primitive shapes like rects, ellipses, and triangles.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>It works by loading the image and creating a bunch of random primitive shapes, then I get the color of the pixel at each point in the image and use that to properly color the shapes. Adjusting the mutation rate changes how much the shapes are allowed to randomize.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked by myself on this experiment. If I am being honest, this is by far my weakest experiment. Nothing I tried really worked out in the long run and I ended up scrapping a lot of stuff, leaving me with rather disheartening results. The generated images don't really capture the likeness of the originals all that much, out of the 3, the tree image rendered with rects is the best. The high of this experiment was just getting the different shapes to render the image and figuring out how to get the color of the pixels on the image. It was also nice when the tree image turned out somewhat okay. The lows were pretty much everything else though and I am very disappointed in the final product.</p>
