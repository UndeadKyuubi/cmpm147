				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The program aims to generate fun stories of classic western duels, but throwing in some weird and wacky twists.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>In this experiment, I altered the template message to fit the type of stories I wanted to generate and added my own fillers to use in the generation.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Getting my own stories generated was a relatively simple process and I didn't really run into any major issues. What took the longest was just thinking about how I wanted to format the story and all of the different fillers I wanted to add.</p>
