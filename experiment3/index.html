				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Generates a map of a dungeon with various tiles</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>It works by creating a grid of characters and then drawing tiles from a tileset using those characters. Autotiling is utilized to create transitions between certain tiles.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked by myself on the experiment. Overall I think it turned out okay. I struggled alot with the autotiling and spent a ton of time just messing around with that. The high of the experiment was definitely when I got the autotiling to work even a little bit, but on the flip side of that, getting the autotiling to work somewhat well was also the biggest low for me in the experiment.</p>
